📖 About the Project

Traditional manual creation of exam seating plans is time-consuming and error-prone — especially for large student groups. This project automates that process by providing:

✔ Student and exam data management
✔ Automated seat generation per exam hall
✔ A user-friendly frontend UI
✔ A backend API to power the logic
✔ Reports or assignments of students to seats

This improves accuracy, saves time, and removes human error from seating assignments.

✨ Features

📋 Add/Edit/View student records

🏫 Manage exam halls and capacities

🪑 Generate seating plans automatically

🚪 Assign students to specific seats in rooms

📦 Organized backend & frontend separation

🔐 Basic validation and status feedback

🧩 Setup & Installation
🧠 Backend

Open the backend/ folder

Install dependencies:

npm install


Create environment variables (e.g., .env):

PORT=5000
DB_URI=your_database_connection_string


Start the backend server:

npm start

🌐 Frontend

Open the frontend/ folder

Install dependencies:

npm install


Start the frontend UI:

npm start

 (default).

Note: Make sure the backend server is running before using the UI.
